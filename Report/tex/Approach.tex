The approach we have chosen to build our solution is by using a set of scripts/functions coded in Matlab\footnote{\url{http://www.mathworks.se/products/matlab/}}. The central part of the solution consists first and foremost of the feature extraction of a sound signal. To extract these features a segmentation step is needed to get only the important parts of the signal. When the features are known about all segments of the sound, the classification process can commence, in which the classifier will use the extracted features and compare it to a dataset used to train the classifier. In the following, these steps will be explained finishing off with a presentation of an application that neatly gathers all these steps in a graphical user interface.
