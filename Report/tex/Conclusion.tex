Through this project we have proposed a working solution to automatically transcribing beatboxing sounds. Using k-NN and a set of features we have successfully classified 3 beatboxing sounds: kick, snare and hi-hat. We tested the performance of the classifier by adjusting the k, and used $X^2$ test with an alpha value p = 0.111 to compare different classifiers to see if they differed significantly. Out of all the features that were tested on, the MFCC performed the best with a precise classification of 98,9\% with $k = 7$ and $k = 8$, window size = 5ms and skip size = 2ms. However, the $X^2$ test showed no significant difference in any of the comparisons, which means the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
