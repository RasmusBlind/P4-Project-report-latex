\section{Investigation}
A great amount of effort has been put into investigating possible solutions to how transcription can be achieved through sound and music computing. While many articles, books and papers on the topic has been scrutinized, three specific articles has been found to be of utmost importance to the project. The articles addresses relevant topics i.e. transcription - / and sound classification of beatboxing.

\subsection{Transcription}
In the article \textit{Towards Automatic Transcription of Expressive Oral Percussive Performances}, Amoury Hazan propose a solution to automatic transcription, that involves sound segregation, oral percussive descriptors, and machine learning techniques. Sound segregation is described as a simple method that fits well with monophonic oral percussive recordings, which requires few computing resources \citep{Hazan2005a}.	

His project aims to reduce the gap between the user and the device (keyboard, drum pad), among other things in order to offer an aid to those musicians who cannot transcript a beat they have in mind.
Through research of the taxonomy of human phonemes, and assuring perfect percussive events through segregation and transcription, the resulting drum score lack information concerning how the performer has modulated the produced sound. Thus, Hazan argues that energy and resonance frequency variation has to be defined together with effective computational methods to track them.
	
The considerations made by Hazan may serve as a benchmark tool which may suffice to serve as a possible solution to the problem. The technical description of the Tree Induction Algorithms may be an area to research, as it could serve as an inspiration regarding how to construct the software based transcription-solution.
