\section{spectral Centroid}
this chapter will show what the feature spectral centroid is.\\
the spectral centroid feature will calculate the center of gravity(COG) of a spectrum. it is defined by the frequency weight power spectrum normalized by the unweigth sum:
\begin{equation}
	\upsilon_{SC}(n) =^{ \sum_{\kappa = 0}^{\frac{K}{2-1}} \kappa\vert X(\kappa,n) \vert^2  }_{ \sum_{\kappa = 0}^{\frac{K}{2-1}} \kappa\vert X(\kappa,n) \vert^2  } 
\end{equation} 
however it can also be calculated using the magnitude spectrum instead of the the power spectrum.
\\
the point found by the spectral centroid feature should correlate with the timbre dimension of how sharp or bright the sound is. 
\\
this feature might be used in a transcription system because it should describe how sharp or bright a sound will sound, so this feature could be used to classify as sound.
