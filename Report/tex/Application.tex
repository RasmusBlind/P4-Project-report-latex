\section{Matlab Application}
Things to remember for the application:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Information on plots
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Axes titles
		\item Axes labels
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

With all the mathematics behind the whole segmentation, feature extraction and classification parts, we realized that instead of having to manually manage each and every function, a more intuitive way of utilizing the whole setup was needed. This lead to the production of a graphical user interface (GUI) consisting of different elements the user could interact with in order to take a piece of sound, segment it and then get an automatic classification. On figure \ref{app-flowchart} a flowchart is provided, presenting the general flow of the application.
