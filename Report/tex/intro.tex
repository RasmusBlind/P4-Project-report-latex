\section{ Introduction }
\subsection{ Imitation of Instruments }
Let’s not mention the old greeks, german yodeling, or the lullabies of our mothers, but instead start from the modern utilization of musical instruments and rhythmic compositions. In the modern ages people have had the need to imitate instruments for several reasons. One is to describe melodies, rhytms, tones and feelings in the creation of music to others. Another reason could be the lack of instruments while still wanting to socially interact with others and to perform complex instrumental patterns vocally. Lastly simply because we as human beings get songs in our heads and intuitively burst out into humming and imitating music we’ve heard because we can’t stop it. One can say that we have had the need to imitate instrumental sounds since the invention of music.
\subsection{ Vocal Percussion }
Using mouth, lips and throat to produce percussion sounds and effects is seen in many cultures all through history. North American scat singing, African Khoisan i.e. Click Language (e.g. Xhosa from South Africa and Khoekhoe from Botswana) are among the cultural examples (Choi, 2013).	
The modern day equivalent is known as Beatboxing which is primarily linked to the early hip-hop-culture in the 1980’ies. The self-proclaimed pioneer of Beatboxing, Doug E. Fresh also known as ‘The Human Beatbox’ was a key player in making Beatboxing famous. However, other earlier artists has been known to use similar techniques of vocal percussion in published material e.g. Paul McCartney with the song “That Would Be Something” from 1969.
\subsection{ Beatboxing }
Beatboxing is generally limited to percussive sounds produced by the vocal cord and body (e.g. clapping) to imitate rhythms of a drumset i.e. snare drum, hi-hat, kick drums, cymbals etc. but some Beatboxers also imitates bass and guitar and occasionally combined with singing. An example of this is Michael Winslow, an American comedian, actor, and beatboxer probably best known for his ability to make sound effects with his voice in the movie Police Academy from 1984. Beatboxing as an artform was an outspring of the hip hop culture since the 1980s. It was shaped by musical technologies in context with its age, and through time it evolved to become a complex instrumental expression. In the origin of beatboxing it was meant to imitate grooves and beats but soon it utilized sounds like basslines, scratching, effects, noise, and almost every musical instrument and “filters”. –With improved techniques and sophisticated microphone technology beatboxing became a modern instrumental element in many music genres of today.

\subsection{ Motivation }
The motivation for this project is the admiration of innovative art forms and to explore the opportunities that arise from them. It is the fact that any analog instrument can be treated as a source for digital and electronic processing. Paradoxically beatboxing comes from imitating other analog instruments, but every other analog instrument is also victimized by digitalization. Jimi Hendrix pushed the creative scope of playing guitar, Jean Michel Jarre by playing piano and electronic drums. Why should beatboxing not be treated as an analog instrument as well? 
\subsection{ Why Beatboxing? }
Beatboxing is constantly advancing and adapting to modern instruments and audio technologies. Take for example the beatboxer Tom Thum who authentically imitates the pounding techno-rhythm from within a night club at a TEDx conference.\footnote{The beatboxer Tom Thum presents his skills at TEDx Sydney, 2013 - \url{http://tedxsydney.com/site/item.cfm?item=91A3E4E1C290F6C97E32B9F2623C8967}}. Furthermore, he concludes his presentation by using a Kaoss Pad\footnote{The Kaoss Pad is a touchpad effect processor manufactured by Korg - \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaoss_Pad}} as a loop station (see chapter \ref{loopstation}), by using the playback to generate an imitation of a jazz band with multiple instruments and lead singer. The internet has contributed to the growing popularity of beatboxing, especially with the creation of the Human Beat Box-community\footnote{\url{www.humanbeatbox.com}} by Alex Tew, who subsequently created the first ever Beatboxing convention in 2003\footnote{The International Human Beatbox Convention - \url{http://www.beatboxconvention.com/}}. A convention that succeeded in assembling beatboxers from around the world. The community is also behind the first beatboxing-tutorials, that were made available in 2003. Standard Beatbox Notation (SBN) was developed by Mark Splinter and Gavin Tyte to create a simple and consistent method to aid novice beatboxers, through the use of standard English characters \citep{tyte2005}.

It is intuitively the fast way forward to learn grooves and rhythms. It only requires creativity to imitate sounds and instruments, while many people also tends to have the ability of humming with decent outcome. If technology can provide additional possibilities to facilitate the creation music that sounds good, it can be an entertaining way to learn the principles of rhythm, and to produce satisfactory music, even that one does not know the basics or the techniques of a traditional instrument.
