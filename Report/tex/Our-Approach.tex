During this section we will describe the way we have chosen to implement a system of transcribing a sequence of beatboxing into a form that can be easily interpreted. The subsections will first off go through the perimeters of what will be transcribed, namely what beatboxing sounds will be analysed on. Secondly a section about data collection will talk about how we have gathered data both for use in the implementation of the system and in the evaluation of the systems performance. When the data has been collected, the actual transcription system can be implemented and will here be described. This is divided into three parts: first how the system will segment audio in order to analyse it, then the analysis of the segmentation, i.e. feature extraction and classification, and finally a presentation of an application with a user interface.

All implementation of the system is done through Matlab\footnote{\url{http://www.mathworks.se/products/matlab/}} using its built-in scripting system. This allows for easy analysis and processing of digital signals.
