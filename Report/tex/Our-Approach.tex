In this chapter we present our approach of implementing an automatic transcription of beatboxing. The first subsection will argue for the delimitation of the chosen beatboxing sound classes to be transcribed. Secondly, a section about data collection will describe how we have gathered data both for use in the implementation and in the evaluation of the system's performance. The actual transcription of the system will then be described. This is divided into three parts; how the system will segment audio in order to analyse it, the analysis of the segmentation, i.e. feature extraction and classification, and finally a presentation of an application with a user interface.

All implementation of the system is done through MATLAB\footnote{\url{http://www.mathworks.se/products/matlab/}} using its built-in scripting system. This allows for easy analysis and processing of digital signals.
