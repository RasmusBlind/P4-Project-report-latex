\section{spectral rolloff}
this chapter will explain what the spectral rolloff is.\\
The Spectral Rolloff is defined as the frequency bin at which the magnitude of the STFT reaches a percentage K of the overall sum of magnitudes, can be calculated like:\\
\begin{equation}\label{ eq:normal spectral rolloff}
	\upsilon_{SR}(n) = i \vert _{\sum_{\kappa = 0}^i \vert X(\kappa, n) \vert = \kappa * \sum_{\kappa = 0}^ {\frac{K}{2-1}}\vert X(\kappa, n) \vert}
\end{equation}
\\
normal the value for K is around 0.85 or 0.95. Low results indicates insufficient magnitudes components at high frequencies and the a low audio bandwidth.\\
different ways to compute the spectral rolloff can be that only parts of the spectral energy is taken into considerations that is done by use an fmin and a fmax:
\begin{equation}\label{ eq: fmin and fmax spectral rolloff}
	\upsilon_{SR}(n) = i \vert _{\sum_{\kappa = \kappa(f_min)}^i \vert X(\kappa, n) \vert = \kappa * \sum_{\kappa = \kappa_(f_min)}^ {\kappa-(f_max)}\vert X(\kappa, n) \vert}
\end{equation}
it can also be common to use the power spectrum
\begin{equation}\label{ eq:power spectral rolloff}
	\upsilon_{SR}(n) = i \vert _{\sum_{\kappa = 0}^i \vert X(\kappa, n) \vert^2 = \kappa * \sum_{\kappa = 0}^ {\frac{K}{2-1}}\vert X(\kappa, n) \vert^2}
\end{equation}
\\
for our project the spectral rolloff could be used to determine the sound in the classification.
