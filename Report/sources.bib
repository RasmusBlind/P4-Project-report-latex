\&quot; problem. We show that under a broad set of conditions (much

broader than independent and identically distributed dimensions), as dimensionality

increases, the distance to the nearest data point approaches

the distance to the farthest data point. To provide a practical perspective,

we present empirical results on both real and synthetic data sets

that demonstrate that this effect can occur for as few as 10-15 dimensions.

Unfortunately, the complexity of most existing search algorithms, such as k-d tree and R-tree, grows exponentially with dimension, making them impractical for dimensionality above 15. In nearly all applications, the closest point is of interest only if it lies within a user specified distance ffl.
